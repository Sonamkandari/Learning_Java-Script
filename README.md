## Explanation
- **internal linking and external linking in java Script**

- Internal linking means writing JavaScript code inside the HTML file, usually within the <script> tag.

- external linking means writing javaScript code in  a separate .js file and linking it to the HTML using <script src="...">

## variable in java Script

- Variables  
- var
- DataType varName =value: strongly type languages like java, C++, and c

- java script is loosely type language it does not have data types and in this types of languages dynamically  data types will be assigned

- we don't have to assign data type to java script it automatically assign data type to variables according to which type of data we are assigning to a particular variable
--- 
- **variable naming convention**
- firstname
- first_name
- FirstName
- firstName
- firstName(camel casing is more preferable)
- 

- ** Invalid naming convention**
- 1age it is invalid way
- 5firstname it is also a invalid way
- #name it is also a invalid way
---
# three variables in javascript
- var - Scope of var key word is global
- const - const is used when we don't have to  update the value of a variable again and again

- **let**- this key word is used when we have to re initialized the values of variables (the scope of let variable  is local)
![alt text](image-1.png)

this will gave an error
![alt text](image-2.png)

- **const**- we preferred to use it when the value of a variable is initialized only once (scope of the variable is local) or we cannot resign the value of the variables
- we have to assign value to a const variable we can not left it without assigning a value

- in case of productions most of the time it is preferred to use const

## Objects in java script and why we create objects in Java Script

- Grouping related data together: instead of many separate variables like personName, personAge,personAddress, we can use an object like person={name:"",age:"",...address:""..}
- Encapsulating functionality + Data
- Organization and maintainability of the code
- avoiding pollution of the pollution of the global namespace / improving scope control

# what is  object Destructuring
- Object destructuring means taking properties out of an object and placing them into variables in one quick step
---
#  what are the common difference between arrow functions and  normal functions in java script
- the first difference is of syntax
- the second difference is of arguments object 
- arrow function does not use arguments objects where as simple functions can use arguments objects in java script
-

# âœ… What is Hoisting?

* Hoisting means JavaScript automatically moves variable and function declarations to the top of their scope before code runs.
## why we use hoisting and why this concept is invented ?
- Hoisting in JavaScript is a mechanism where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase, before the code is executed. This means that you can use functions and variables before they are formally declared in your code.

- **note** we can not do hoisting in case of arrow functions
